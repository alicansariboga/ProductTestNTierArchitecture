# TestNTierArchitecture

### Description:

After GetAll() from ProductManager, CRUD operations in EfEntityRepository should be performed, but CRUD operations in EfProductDal are performed instead. More precisely, this is the expectation of the program. Therefore, to keep the program running for now, I added the general CRUD operations in EfEntityRepository to the Product object, added it to the EfProductDal class, and ran it this way. I will fix this situation as soon as possible and continue my work.
